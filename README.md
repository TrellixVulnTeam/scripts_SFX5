The scripts repository is my playground and all-round dumping ground for everything I need to automate. Much of the repository is coded with `Python` due to my adopting that scripting language first. But there is small additions of `Ruby`, `PHP`, `Golang` and a bigger dose of `Bash`.

Much of it could be trimmed and deleted due to neglect but I end up keeping it around just in case I need to look up how to do something (as if the internet did not exist).

The easiest way to view the repository is by date modified. This will, at least, give a glimpse at what scripts have been updated recently and what haven't been touched in years.
